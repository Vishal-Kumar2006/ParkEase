<h1>🚗 ParkEase – Smart Parking Made Easy</h1> 
ParkEase is a full-stack MERN application designed to simplify the process of finding and reviewing parking spots. It helps users make informed decisions by offering reviews, real-time data (coming soon), and enhanced security features. Built as part of my MERN stack journey, ParkEase continues to grow with every feature update.
